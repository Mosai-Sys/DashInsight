# AGENTS.MD – System Architecture & Build Plan

Version: 2.0

✅ `agent.md` is now populated with **System Architecture Version 2.0**.  
It serves as the **primary architectural blueprint** for Codex, providing all the technical definitions required to autonomously build the full application stack.

It includes:
- Microservice descriptions  
- API Gateway and federated GraphQL structure  
- Dataset ingestion and analysis pipelines  
- In-browser AI (Phi-3 via ONNX Runtime Web)  
- Prescriptive optimization and interactive simulation  
- Full GraphQL schema and KPI definitions  
- Frontend architecture and AI component flow  
- Security, licensing, and privacy considerations

This file enables Codex to understand and generate all services, components, and data flows in the project.
